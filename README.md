# Functional programming exercises solutions
This is the repository with solutions from Functional programming (Programowanie funkcyjne) exercises at AGH. Here I will share all of the codes written by me. All codes are written in English but the content of the labs is in Polish. Also all codes are written in Haskell in Jupyter Notebook.
## Table of contents
Table of contents consists of specific sections in repository. Each section consists of jupyter notebook in which there are contents of the labs and solutions.
