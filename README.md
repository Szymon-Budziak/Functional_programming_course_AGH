# Functional_programming_exercises_solutions
This is the repository with solutions from Functional programming (Programowanie funkcyjne) exercises at AGH. Here I will share all of the codes written by me. All codes are written in English but the content of the exercises is in Polish. Also all codes are written in Haskell in Jupyter Notebook. There is Haskell kernel for Jupyter Notebook.

IHaskell - kernel for the Jupyter Notebook: https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell
