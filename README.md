# Functional programming course at AGH UST
The repository with solutions from Functional programming (Programowanie funkcyjne) lab classes at AGH UST. Here I will share all of the codes written by me and codes written during laboratories. All codes are written in English but the content is in Polish. The leading programming language during this course was Haskell that was used along the Jupyter Notebook. The repository consists of solutions for assignments during the course.
## Table of contents
Table of contents consists of specific sections in repository. Each section consists of jupyter notebook in which there are contents of the labs and solutions.
